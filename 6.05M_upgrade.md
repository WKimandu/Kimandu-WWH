Yikes – to remove ambiguity and I have updated this internally.

@William / DAVID to update?
The upgrade process for ACI follows this pattern.
On Software general availability – Cisco advices that we wait for 6 to 8 weeks, this allows for ample time to see if new bugs and stability issues are detected.
After 6 weeks, we can request a bug scrub (NDI will help somewhat)but we still need a bug scrub 
this takes another 2 weeks. 
If no bugs are found after our ACI via Cisco Bug Scrubs, we then ask NTT ops to test the software in their LAB. (?)
- depending on how soon NTT can test – and with more internal discussion we will schedule to upgrade a single site
So, the soonest we can upgrade EID will be 12 weeks from March 15, 2024 - unless Cisco advice otherwise.
By this time we expect that the software version will be gold starred*
Please be advised that Cisco can also advice not to upgrade to this image

Here we will try to out this info in a tabular , calendar format

extract key facts and duration from the above text
- 6 - 8 weeks to wait after software GA
- 2 weeks for bug scrub
- 2 weeks for NTT LAB testing
- 12 weeks from March 15, 2024 for EID upgrade
- Gold star software version
- Cisco can advice not to upgrade
